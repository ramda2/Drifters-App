# Drifters-App
Senior Project

Designed in Swift, Drifters is a mobile app that allows Liquor Store Owners to buy wholesale liquor. 
Designed as a functional inventory system for Senior Project, it connects with a MYSQL database hosted on a 
private server to store and exchange data. Users can browse, search, and add items to their own unique cart by 
creating an account. Guests are more than welcomed to preview our items. 

Note: This is not a live app and is for demo purposes only.
